### Hi, I'm Endre

I build data systems at research scale — Python, Rust, Svelte.

**Currently:** Research Data Engineer at [Center for Collective Learning](https://centerforcollectivelearning.org/) (Corvinus University), building [Rankless](https://www.rankless.org/) — a platform for exploring 3B+ citations across 300M scholarly papers.

**Previously:** Data Scientist at Lidl (ML for demand prediction & logistics optimization at European scale) | Founded [SSCUB](https://sscu-budapest.github.io/) for shared research data infrastructure | [Teaching](https://rajk.eu) programming & algorithms since 2015

**I care about:** building things from scratch with minimal dependencies, code quality, performance, and owning what I ship.
